# benford-index

A python application for measuring financial volatility in major indexes using Benford's law

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law">Benford's law</a> is phenomenon whereby the leading digits of some types of stochastic data follow a particular distribution.
There have been several suggestions as to why this occurs however there is considerable debate as to the cause.

The distribution has been widely used in forensic data analysis, for example in identifying where companies might be cooking the books. Other research has compared the benford distribution with data from <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-88-470-1481-7_10">financial markets</a>.

With this idea in mind, this project compares the Beford distribution with characteristics of several major market indices (S&P 500, FTSE 100 etc)
